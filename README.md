This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where a server fails to start because the specified port is already in use.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a robust solution.

The issue arises when the server tries to bind to a port that's currently occupied by another process.  This often happens during development when restarting the server without first ensuring the port is free.

The solution incorporates error handling and a delay to allow for graceful port release, making the server more resilient.
